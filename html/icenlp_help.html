<h2>Tokenization</h2>
<p>
First the tokenizer performs sentence segmentation and then it tokenizes each sentence.
If 'strict tokenization' is chosen then it applies stricter rules when deciding what constitutes a token.
</p>
<h2>Tagging</h2>
The linguistic rule-based tagger <i>IceTagger</i> is used for tagging.
<p>You can either:
    <ol>
        <li>perform full disambiguation using <i>IceTagger</i>, or </li>
        <li>use a HMM tagger for initial (word class) disambiguation and <i>IceTagger</i> for full disambiguation.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>Parsing is carried out by the incremental finite-state parser <i>IceParser</i>.
The parser annotates phrase structure and syntactic functions, according to a shallow syntactic annotation scheme.
The default behaviour of <i>IceParser</i> is to use word order to guide the analysis, but an option is provided to rely on feature agreement as well.
The parser can also suggest grammatical errors in noun phrases and in subjects of verbs.
